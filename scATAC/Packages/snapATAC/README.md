## Step 1. Barcode selection

1) number of unique fragments: Taking the log10 fo passed_filters (**number of non-duplicate,non-mit, high quality,nonchimeric usable read-pairs**)
2) fragments in promoter ratio: *promoter_region_fragments / passed_filters* meaning **(number of fragments overlapping promoter regions) / (number of non-duplicate,non-mit, high quality,nonchimeric usable read-pairs)**
