## Biological Terms that One should know
Transcriptomics: The study of transcriptomes and their functions.

Transcriptome: The transcriptome is the set of all RNA molecules in one cell or a population of cells.

Bulk RNA-seq : Measures the average expression level for each gene across a large population of input cells

	* Useful for comparative transcriptomics, e.g. samples of the same tissue from different species

	* Insufficient for studying heterogeneous systems, e.g. early development studies, complex tissues (brain)

	* Does not provide insights into the stochastic nature of gene expression
